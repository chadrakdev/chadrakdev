### 👨🏾‍💻 About me
I am a passionate developer, primarily working in C# and React, in a full-stack environment with experience in both financial and real estate marketing services. 

I enjoy spending my time building different projects, so I scratch that itch with freelance work as well as personal projects - the more fun ones can be found further down under my <i>Pinned</i> projects (if you're interested) or you can check them out on my [portfolio](https://chadrak.dev).

### ✨ Project Spotlight
#### Game Store API
A backend application built with .NET, following the MVC pattern, that consumes and parses data from the Steam API, mapping the data to usable models for consumption and also includes interfaced services for API integration and data handling.
